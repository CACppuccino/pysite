I am planning writing a shell script for deploying the website on the AWS server. Such a pain.  
Still need to register a domain name and install redis and get a https license  

** deployment list(using yum and pip3/python34 pip) **  
* yum *  
  
> update itself first  
> epel-release (intend for python34)  
> python34  
> httpd24  
> httpd24-devel  
> httpd24-tools  
> mysql56-server  
  
* pip * using python34 -m pip install ...  

> virtualenv
